# Stox - Practice Stock Trading

## Description

Stox is a web application that supports users in educational (and risk-free) stock trading. Users start with a hypothetical allowance of $50,000 with which they can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies and ETFs. The Stox dashboard tracks asset growth, presents real-time (ish) market data on different securities, and provides the user with up-to-date business news that might be relevant to their trading decisions.

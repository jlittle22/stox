# Stox - Practice Stock Trading

## Description

Stox is a web application that supports users in educational (and risk-free) stock trading. Users start with a hypothetical allowance of $50,000 with which they can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies and ETFs. The Stox dashboard tracks asset growth, presents real-time (ish) market data on different securities, and provides the user with up-to-date business news that might be relevant to their trading decisions.

## Design

### Front End
The Stox front end is simply HTML, CSS, and Javascript with no additional frameworks or libraries (other than jQuery). The UI is designed to be easily maleable. A single line change in the site.css file can alter the color scheme across the application. The UI is divided into 4 components as shown below: the Search, Your Stocks, News, and Profile.

Any security that is owned or searched for will present a modal of relevant information to the user when clicked. Clicking news articles redirects the user to the article in a different tab.
